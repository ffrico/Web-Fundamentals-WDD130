      <h3>Data Centers</h3>
      <p>
        The datacenter solution from Cybertec will offer a model that allows the customization of the hardware of the racks. This means that Cybertec will be able to adjust the circuits and modules in a way that can meet the company’s requirements to boost data processing. It's important to keep in mind that a server rack could be for a datacenter, a network server, and more, but Cybertec in this case will focus on the solution for a datacenter. The page will display a model called “Nucleus V." It will contain a description of the model, providing specifications and capabilities that will attract the interest of a company. The page will display two images featuring the model’s rack and the circuits. Since circuits and CPUs are a crucial part of this hardware, it will talk in detail about the components inside the datacenter, such as the name of the CPU brand, the number of storage units and compatible models, the number of RAM sticks and generation, and more. Since this is a powerful data center, it will contain a notice highlighted stating that Cybertec is not responsible for costly energy use due to the powerful components of the server. Cybertec will offer technical assistance as part of the purchase of the product.

For each component, it will provide a brief explanation of why the selected component will provide great performance to the system and why it will be useful in a corporate environment. Most modern computers focus on giving a description of the most crucial part of the computer, which is the processing unit CPU. This computer will feature an AMD processor. Since this computer is intended for corporate environments, it will give examples of the areas in which this PC performs best. Some of these can be AutoCAD, Photoshop, virtualization up to eight VMs at the same time, and more. Cybertec will also offer a warranty for 10 years, but only for the purchase models. Cybertec will encourage us to stay up to date with newer models in a highlighted section. While it is going to be a technical description, it will also explain why it is a powerful solution.
