        <h2>Fabian Rico</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Fabian, and I am from Venezuela. I'm currently living in Katy, Texas. My major is Applied Technology, and I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree. I am not only a student but also a worker. I work full-time at a distribution center, then I dedicate the other time of the day to study, I took four classes last semester, and it was a challenge but also easy. I started with Pathway Connect around 2020, then enrolled in BYU-Idaho. It is a great blessing to study here and expand my knowledge while also learning the Gospel.

        <p>In my spare time, I go to the gym to maintain a healthy lifestyle and become stronger. I enjoy trying new things and visiting new places. When I want to watch something, I watch anime.</p>
        <p>Web design is something that has caught my attention since I was a teenager. I was fascinated by how complex and useful a web application can be. We can do a lot of things without installing an app on the system, and I think that is interesting. I hope to learn a lot from everyone!</p>
